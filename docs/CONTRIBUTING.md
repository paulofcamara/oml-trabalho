# Contributing Guide

## Pull Requests

A Pull Request (PR) is a method of submitting contributions to the project. It lets you:
- Notify team members that you've completed a feature
- Review code changes before they're merged into the main branch
- Discuss potential modifications and improvements
- Get feedback on your changes

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch from `master`
2. Make your changes and commit them
3. Push your branch to GitHub
4. Open a Pull Request against the `master` branch
5. Wait for review and approval
6. Once approved, your changes will be merged

### Best Practices

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Write clear PR descriptions
- Respond to review comments promptly
- Keep changes small and manageable
